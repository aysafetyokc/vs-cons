Welcome to the Official blog of Vanguard Safety. We are proud to announce that we are partnering with Metro Technology Centers to bring you S.A.F.E. @ 1400.

This is our initiative to bring you practical safety training that is not your ordinary topics. We cover things such as weather safety, local resources, rescue protocols, and much more with our invited guest speakers from the safety industry in Oklahoma. S.A.F.E. stands for Safety Awareness For Everyone and that is truly what we are bringing you with this wide variety of useful seminars.
